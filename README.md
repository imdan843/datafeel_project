# datafeel_project
Included are two samples of what can be achieved with the datafeel dots. The folder called Temperature and Light will change the dots light to match the average colour of the screen while the temperature of the dots will either get hotter when there is a warmer color and colder when there is a colder color. To use this program, connect the dots and drag and drop an mp4 file into the console. The folder called beat detection ableton will change make the dots vibrate to the beats of the song. To use this open up ableton and drag the bpm_counter device to the track you want the detection to occur in. For best results, split up the track into different instruments and apply the device to the drum track only.
